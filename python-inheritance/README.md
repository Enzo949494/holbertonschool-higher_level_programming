# 📐 Python Inheritance Project
## 🎯 Description
This project explores object-oriented programming in Python, focusing on inheritance. We've created several classes that demonstrate the principles of inheritance, method overriding, and attribute validation.
## 🧩 Classes Implemented
### 🔬 BaseGeometry
* Base class for geometric shapes
* Includes method for area calculation (not implemented)
* Provides integer validation
### 🔶 Rectangle (inherits from BaseGeometry)
* Represents a rectangle
* Initializes with width and height
* Implements area calculation
* Provides string representation
### ◼️ Square (inherits from Rectangle)
* Represents a square
* Initializes with a single size parameter
* Overrides string representation to show it's a square
## 🚀 Key Concepts Covered
* Class inheritance
* Method overriding
* Private attributes
* Input validation
* String representation of objects
## 💻 Usage
Each class can be imported and used to create geometric shape objects. They provide methods for area calculation and string representation.
## ✅ Testing
Test files are provided to demonstrate the functionality of each class.
