# 🐍 Python Abstract Classes
## 🌟 Introduction
This README provides a brief overview of abstract classes in Python, a powerful feature for creating base classes that define a common interface for derived classes.
## 🔑 Key Concepts
### 🏗️ Abstract Base Class (ABC)
* Imported from the abc module
* Cannot be instantiated directly
* Serves as a blueprint for other classes
### 📝 Abstract Methods
* Defined using the @abstractmethod decorator
* Must be implemented by child classes
### 🎯 Purpose
* Enforce a common interface across related classes
* Provide a way to share code among multiple related classes
## 💻 Basic Usage
````
python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AbstractClass(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def abstract_method(self):
        pass

class ConcreteClass(AbstractClass):
    def abstract_method(self):
        print("Implemented abstract method")
````
### 🚀 Benefits
* Improves code organization
* Ensures consistency in derived classes
* Facilitates polymorphism
### ⚠️ Note
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated on their own and require subclasses to implement all abstract methods.
